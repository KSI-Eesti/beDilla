            recipe: "3 balls of Ndolé, 500g beef (or meat of your choice), cut into pieces, 2 onions, chopped, 400g peanuts, peeled, 2 tablespoons of dried crayfish, 1 stock cube (Maggi), 2 garlic cloves, minced, 200ml oil (peanut, sunflower or palm), salt, pepper and chilli, to taste",
            description: "Step 1: Washing the Ndolé leaves, Tips: The step is not really mandatory when you buy the Ndolé balls but I would recommend doing it at the same time. Boil the leaves in a large pot filled with water with a little rock salt. After boiling, remove the leaves using a strainer, pour and change the water. Repeat the operation for at least 2 times. This step will remove the bitterness from the leaves. Step 2: Boil the peanuts for 15 minutes, then let them cool and make a paste with a little water in a food processor or mortar. Step 3: Heat the oil and sauté the onions, add the garlic and pepper. Add the meat and brown for a few minutes. Step 4: Add peanut paste and water. Let the meat and the peanut paste cook for at least 40 minutes. Step 5: Add the Ndolé leaves, then the dried crayfish, salt, stock cube and chilli. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Turn the sauce from time to time to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Serve with miondo (cassava stick) or rice. Enjoy your meal!"

            image: "./assets/reduxPhotos/eru.jpg",
            recipe: "6 cups of Eru/Ukasi, 3 bundles of spinach/Waterleaf, 2-3 pounds of meat/fish of choice(beef skin/canda, beef stripes, beef, goat meat, dried/smoked fish, stocked fish, snails, and/or others),2 cups of crayfish, 3 cups of palm oil plus half cup of canola (or groundnut) oil, 1 crayfish seasoning cube (Maggi Crevette), 1 Habanero pepper (optional), Salt to taste",
            description: "If you are using dried Eru, start by soaking it in water. Wash your meat and put in the pot to boil. I used beef skin and beef stripes AKA canda and towel. While the meat boils, chop your spinach or waterleaf and set aside. When your meat is half-boiled, season with salt. When it is cooked, add in spinach and start stirring. Spinach is quite soft and will shrink fast as seen below. Then you drain Eru and add to pot. The small liquid from the Spinach will make the Eru soft. Add in your fish and mix. I had some already boiled stock fish so I threw it in. Then add the oil, seasoning cube and lastly crayfish. Tip : Mixing palm oil and canola/vegetable oil keeps the oil from becoming hard when the Eru is cold. Stir well and voila, Eru is ready. Serve with Water Fufu (Akpu), Garri or even Pounded Yam."
